=head1 GETTING STARTED

=head2 INSTALL THE SDK

To edit the code and/or deploy to your iDevice, you'll first need to install
the iPhone SDK: L<http://developer.apple.com/iphone/index.action>

=head2 GET THE CODE

You can either clone the main repository:

    git clone git@github.com:oalders/iCPAN.git

Or, you can fork this on GitHub and then clone your own fork of the repo.  This
would be the recommended way of doing things:

    git clone git@github.com:yournamehere/iCPAN.git
    
=head2 GET THE DATABASE

You can find the database snapshots at:
L<http://icpan.wundercounter.com/sqlite> The folders are organized by version
number. Download the iCPAN.sqlite.zip file in the appropriate folder, unzip it
and copy it into your top iCPAN folder. For example, to download the code for
v1.0.0

    cd iCPAN
    git checkout -b v1.0.0 v1.0.0
    curl -C - -O http://icpan.wundercounter.com/sqlite/1.0.0/iCPAN.sqlite.zip
    unzip iCPAN.sqlite.zip

=head2 ADD THE DATABASE TO YOUR XCODE PROJECT

To add the file to your Xcode project, open your project in Xcode and
CTRL-click on the Resources folder. Choose "Add" -> "Existing Files". Choose
the sqlite file you just unzipped. You will then be presented with a list of
options for adding the file. You should be fine to accept the defaults.

=head2 BUILD AND RUN

At this point, you can click the Xcode "Build and Run" button to deploy the
app to your iPhone simulator.
